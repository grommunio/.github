# Hello World!

**We are grommunio, a software company (and community) based in beautiful Vienna, Austria. :ferris_wheel:**

With grommunio it no longer matters how many communication channels you use. The inefficiency of context switches in your team’s communication is a thing of the past with grommunio. At the same time, grommunio provides highest levels of privacy and security for one of your most valuable goods: your data.

Decide for yourself where your data is stored – at home :house_with_garden:, on your server :office:, in your data center :night_with_stars: or in a public cloud :cloud:.

grommunio runs with just a single user up to many hundreds of thousands of users, from a rasberry pi to mainframes or even geo-split installations distributed all over the world.

## _The_ turnkey open source enterprise communication solution

grommunio is unique: it is drop-in compatible with Microsoft Exchange, providing all relevant messaging protocols to its open source and prorietary clients such as Microsoft Outlook without the installation of MAPI extensions on the client. grommunio is even compatible with Outlook 2010 and 2013, while it is not recommended to still run these old versions anymore.

## Open Source

grommunio would not be possible without free and open source software. We believe in open source - we believe it is important for both, our society and organizations. With the right team, you accomplish a lot and add value to the community.
