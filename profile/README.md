# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

**We are grommunio, a software company (and community) based in beautiful Vienna, Austria.**

With grommunio it no longer matters how many communication channels you use. The inefficiency of context switches in your teamâ€™s communication is a thing of the past with grommunio. At the same time, grommunio provides a independently proven high level of privacy and security for one of your most valuable goods: your data.

Decide for yourself where your data is stored â€“ on your server, in your data center, in the public cloud.

grommunio runs with just a single user up to many hundreds of thousands of users, from a rasberry pi to mainframes or even geo-split environments with the highest demands.

## Open Source :penguin:

grommunio would not be possible without free and open source software. We believe in open source - we believe it is important for both, our society and organizations. With the right team, you accomplish a lot and add value to the community.

## Security :lock:
