# Hello World! 👋

**We are grommunio, a software company (and community) based in beautiful Vienna, Austria.**

With grommunio it no longer matters how many communication channels you use. The inefficiency of context switches in your team’s communication is a thing of the past with grommunio. At the same time, grommunio provides highest levels of privacy and security for one of your most valuable goods: your data.

Decide for yourself where your data is stored – at home :house_with_garden:, on your server :office:, in your data center :night_with_stars: or in a public cloud :cloud:.

grommunio runs with just a single user up to many hundreds of thousands of users, from a rasberry pi to mainframes or even geo-split installations distributed all over the world.

## Open Source :penguin:

grommunio would not be possible without free and open source software. We believe in open source - we believe it is important for both, our society and organizations. With the right team, you accomplish a lot and add value to the community.
